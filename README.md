# svelte-ts-webpack-template
A template for building [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) apps using Typescript and Webpack.

You can learn Svelte [here](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/)

## Get Started
Install the dependencies (with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
```bash
npm install
```
and start
```bash
npm run dev

Webpack will tell you where your app is served (eg. [localhost:8080](localhost:8080))
